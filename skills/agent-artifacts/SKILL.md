# Agent Artifacts

Agent definitions are markdown files with YAML frontmatter. For the full
frontmatter schema (fields, values, harness overrides, model policies,
fanout), see the [mars agent profile reference](https://github.com/meridian-flow/mars-agents/blob/main/docs/config/agent-profiles.md).

The body below frontmatter is the system prompt. Opening matters most — it
survives compaction and gets strongest attention. Let skills carry
methodology the agent shares with others; the body carries what's unique
to this agent.

Descriptions serve callers, not the agent. Lead with the problem it solves
and when to reach for it, then teach how to use it effectively.

Managers and leads coordinate — they don't implement. Use
`disallowed-tools: [Agent]` to force `meridian spawn` (which provides
tracking and reports).

For meridian-specific conventions (subagent design, context handoffs, model
staffing), see `resources/meridian.md`.
