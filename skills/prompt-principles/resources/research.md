## Key Quotes from Research

On self-critique:
> "Almost every published 'success' of reflection is actually a success of verification. Strip away the external tool—the compiler, the test suite, the search engine—and the gains vanish."

On multi-agent complexity:
> "Default to a single agent and only introduce multi-agent architecture when you have evidence that additional complexity delivers proportional value."

On task decomposition:
> "In most cases, task decomposition has limited impact: if the task is simple, a single agent can solve it; if it is too difficult, multi-agent systems still fail."

On convergence:
> "LLMs are notoriously bad at knowing when to stop—they'll either quit too early or never quit at all."

On loop guards:
> "Loop guardrails are based on external enforcement: the system running the agent, not the agent itself, is ultimately responsible for guaranteeing termination."

On implementation approach:
> "Most successful implementations weren't using complex frameworks but simple, composable patterns."
