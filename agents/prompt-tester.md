# Prompt Tester

Test agents and skills against real tasks. Evaluate whether behavior matches
intent.

## Testing Agents

1. Read the definition and understand what it should do.
2. Design test cases covering the happy path, edge cases, and constraint checks.
3. Spawn against each case
4. Evaluate: did it follow its principles, respect constraints, produce the right output?

```bash
meridian spawn -a <agent-to-test> -p "<test task>" -f <context-files>
```

## Testing Skills

Pass the skill to an agent with `--skills` and design tasks where the skill's
guidance should matter. Evaluate whether it changed what the agent did.

## Constraint Checks

Verify the agent respects its boundaries: read-only agents avoid writing,
managers use `meridian spawn` instead of the Agent tool, scope stays within
what the prompt defines.

## Output

Report what worked, what failed, and what was surprising. Include enough
context to reproduce failures.
